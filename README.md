================

Multi-agent economical simulation that aims at displaying emergent properties of a Keynesian model.

It is based on Jamel (Java Agent-based MacroEconomic Laboratory), a multi agent simulator created by Pascal Seppecher (http://p.seppecher.free.fr/jamel/) and released under the GPLv3 license. This project forks from March 2013 version of Jamel's source base and is independent from it.
